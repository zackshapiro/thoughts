### Life
* The best things in life almost don't happen.
* There are no rules.
* Life is about three things: Storytelling, Contrast, and making decisions easy for other people.
* No one knows anything.
* Most people express opinions as facts.
* Go.
* It's important to be flexible with beliefs; my beliefs and opinions may change with the facts.
* A man should have a mystery about him, how he does all that he does.
* Take information, synthesize it for yourself and then form your opinion.
* I'm only racing me.
* Only measure yourself against yourself.
* College is about transporting information from the first day to the last. You don't have to learn anything, really, other than how to play the game. 
* Confidence and direct attacks in the face of fear.
* Humor comes from our differences and timing.
* Surround yourself with physical books.


### The Universe
* There's something magical about the ocean; it's the perfect metaphor for anything you're going through.
* I believe in God, I'm just not sure what to do with that belief yet.
* I really want there to be something after life.
* Mathematically, there have to be other life forms out there, somewhere.


### Self
* Always trust your gut.
* "What you are thinking about you are becoming." - Muhammad Ali
* Do the next one.
* I hope I'm always this good at falling asleep.
* Everything is linked to exercise: eating well, sleeping, discipline.
* I work really well off of a to-do list


### Relationships
* Fidelity is of the utmost importance.
* We're all going through the same things. Reach out. The worst you can get is a 'no.'
* Marriage should be extended to everyone.
* Surprise is important.
* It's important to take chances on people.


### Creating
* A man should build things with his hands.
* The details are the product.
* Momentum is a hell of a drug.
* Build things and tell people.
* The more consistent you are with what you're working on, the more people notice.
* Teams and communities produce more than the sum of their parts.
* Everything is built in a million little steps; do as many steps well as you can each day.
* Work with those that want it and fit culturally, not necessarily the most qualified.
